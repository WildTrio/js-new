-------pseudocode-------
<event-target>.addeventlistner(<event to listen for>,<functtion to run when event happened>,<use capture>)
to run addeventlistner three things to be known
    1.event target-component on which listner to be applied
    2.event type-(click,double-click,hover etc)
    3.function-define what to do when event happen
-------phases of an event-------
    1.capaturing phase
    2.at target phase
    3.bubbling phase
by default the event listner executes at bubbling phase
but if we want to change it to capturing phase then-
    addeventlistner(<type>,function,true)
to apply event listner at target phase apply both use-capture="true" and use-capture="true"


-------the default action
anchor tag-opens link
we can prevent default action by .preventDefault()
